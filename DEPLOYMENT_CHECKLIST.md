   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Node version: `18` (or higher)

3. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Site Functionality
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works (Home, Translate, About)
- [ ] Direct URL access works (e.g., `yoursite.netlify.app/#/translate`)
- [ ] API test component works
- [ ] Translation functionality works

### 2. Check Console for Errors
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] No 404 errors for routes
- [ ] API calls are working

### 3. Test API Connection
- [ ] Click "Test API Connection" on translate page
- [ ] Verify connection to sign.mt API
- [ ] Test actual translation functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still get "Page Not Found":

1. **Clear Netlify cache:**
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Clear cache and deploy site

2. **Check redirects:**
   - Verify `_redirects` file is in the build folder
   - Check Netlify redirects in Site settings > Build & deploy > Redirects

3. **Force redeploy:**
   - Trigger a new deployment from Netlify dashboard

### If API calls fail:

1. **Check CORS:**
   - Verify sign.mt API allows requests from your domain
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **Environment variables:**
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://sign.mt` in Netlify environment variables

## 📱 Final Steps

1. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Add custom domain in Netlify settings
   - Configure DNS records

2. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Netlify provides free SSL certificates automatically

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Set up CDN if needed

## 🎉 Success!

Your React.js sign language translation app should now be live and working correctly on Netlify!
